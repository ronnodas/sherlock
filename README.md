# About

This is a solver for [Clues by Sam](https://cluesbysam.com). The solver part is not that interesting but the clue parsing is quite complicated (and almost tautologically incomplete).

## How to run

* Use `cargo run` in the root directory (with `cargo` installed).
* To be able to download the daily puzzle, put an API token from [browserless](https://www.browserless.io/) in a file named `browserless_api_key` in the current directory.
